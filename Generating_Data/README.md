The file mpl_squares.py, defines a simple line graph using Matplotlib to plot the square numbers 1, 4, 9,16, and 25. It then customizes the plot to make it more informative by adding markers to the data points, changing the color and style of the line, adding labels for the x-axis and y-axis, a title, gridlines, and customizing the ticks on the x-axis and y-axis. Finally, it displays the plot using plt.show().

The file scatter_squares.py, uses matplotlib to create a scatter plot with a single pointat coordinates (2, 4) and a point size of 200. The plot is then customized with a title, axis labels, and tick label sizes before being displayed.

The file 0-scatter_squares.py, the x_values list contains the numbers to be squared, and y_values contains the square of each number. When these lists are passed to scatter(),
matplotlib reads one value from each list as it plots each point. The points
to be plotted are (1, 1), (2, 4), (3, 9), (4, 16), and (5, 25);
